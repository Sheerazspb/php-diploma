In comparison with Germany, there are not so many dialects in Russia. Of course, there are differences in pronunciation. Russian Russian Russian can be divided into three main language groups: Northern Russian, southern Russian and Central Russian. The competitive pronunciation is based on the Russian one-and-a-half group, which is Spokane in Moscow. This is due to the fact that Russia has always been a strong Central country. The differences in dialog boxes consist mainly of intonation and stress. Russian Russian pronunciation of the South and Central is typical of the so-called "Akane" (pronunciation of the sound " or "as" in "in syllables is not stressed), in the dialogues of the Northern Russian there is"okane". But he must have said that these little differences disappear completely.

Russian language has much in common with South Slavic languages: Bulgarian, Serbian, etc. In Western Slavic languages the differences are much more. There are many words that are similar but have a completely different meaning. These are the so-called "false friends of the translator". We have many borrowings from French and German. Many anglicisms are also used nowadays.
